# Problem 1

Load Instacart Data

``` r
data("instacart")
```

`instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations, each row representing a
product from an order. There are 131209 unique orders in the dataset.
There are 15 variables. `eval_set` represents which evaluation set this
orders belongs in, which this data specifically only includes data from
the “train” eval_set.

Some key variables include `order_dow` and `order_hour_of_day`,
representing the day of the week and hour of the day the order was
placed respectively. `days_since_prior_order` represents the number of
days since the last order, capped at 30 and NA if this is the customer’s
first order. `product_name`, `aisle_name`, and `department` represents
the product, aisle, and department name respectively. `aisle_id`,
`department_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, and `user_id` represents the
aisle, department, order, product, and user id respectively.
`add_to_card_order` represents the order in which each product was added
to cart. `reordered` indicates 1 if the product has been ordered in the
past and 0 otherwise. The average order day is 3, representing Thursday.
The average order time is 14:00. For the customers who have ordered from
instacart previously, the average days since the last order is 17 days.

##### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

Calculate which aisles have the most items ordered

``` r
num_aisle_insta = 
  instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  summarize(
    n = n() # counts observations for each group
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) #arrange in desc order
```

There are 134 different aisles. `fresh vegetables` aisle has the most
items ordered of 150609 items.

##### Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

Create plot

``` r
num_aisle_insta |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> #keep those with more than 10000 orders
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered", 
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle \nfor >10,000 items ordered", 
  ) +
  coord_flip()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kr3145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot shows that among aisles that have more than 10,000 items
ordered, the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles have the most
items ordered. The items ordered in each of fresh vegetables and fresh
fruits aisles has around two times the items ordered compared to the
packaged vegetables fruits aisle, the aisle with the third most ordered
items. Dry paste, oils vinegars, and butter aisle has the least number
of items ordered.

##### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |> 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |> 
  summarize(
    items_ordered_count = n()
  ) |> 
  arrange(aisle, desc(items_ordered_count)) |> 
  slice_head(n = 3) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| aisle | product_name | items_ordered_count |
|:---|:---|---:|
| baking ingredients | Light Brown Sugar | 499 |
| baking ingredients | Pure Baking Soda | 387 |
| baking ingredients | Cane Sugar | 336 |
| dog food care | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats | 30 |
| dog food care | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe | 28 |
| dog food care | Small Dog Biscuits | 26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries | 5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries | 4966 |

Packaged vegetables fruits aisle has the most overall items ordered
compared to bakign ingredeints and dog food care aisle. Organic baby
spinach, organic raspberries, and organic blueberries are the top three
items ordered in the packaged vegetables fruits aisle. Little brown
sugar, pure baking soda, and cane sugar are top three items ordered in
the baking ingredients aisle. Snack sticks chicken & rice recipe dog
treats, organix chicken & brown rice recipe, and small dog biscuits are
the top three items ordered in dog food care aisle.

##### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |> 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_hour_of_day = round(mean(order_hour_of_day), 2)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour_of_day
  ) |> 
  rename( 
    sunday = `0`,
    monday = `1`,
    tuesday = `2`, 
    wednesday = `3`, 
    thursday = `4`, 
    friday = `5`, 
    saturday = `6`
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     | sunday | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday | saturday |
|:-----------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream |  13.77 |  14.32 |   15.38 |     15.32 |    15.22 |  12.26 |    13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples |  13.44 |  11.36 |   11.70 |     14.25 |    11.55 |  12.78 |    11.94 |

On average, coffee ice cream is purchased at a later time of the day
compared to compared to pink lady apples. One exception is on Friday,
where pink lady apples is purchased at a slightly earlier time compared
to coffee ice cream. Both coffee ice cream and pink lady apples are
purchased in late morning/afternoon part of the day.

  left_join(zip_zori_df, zip_code_df, by = "zip_code")
```

##### There are 116 months between January 2015 and August 2024. How many ZIP codes are observed 116 times? How many are observed fewer than 10 times? Why are some ZIP codes are observed rarely and others observed in each month?

Calculate number of zip codes observed 116 times

``` r
combined_zip_zori_df |> 
  drop_na(price) |> 
  group_by(zip_code) |> 
  summarize(
    observed_per_zip_code = n()
  ) |>

    ## 1                   116    48

48 zip codes are observed 116 times.

Calculate number of zip codes observed fewer than 10 times

``` r
combined_zip_zori_df |> 
  drop_na(price) |> 
  group_by(zip_code) |> 
  summarize(
    observed_per_zip_code = n()

```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   less_10_zips
    ##          <int>
    ## 1           26

There are 26 zip codes that are observed less than 10 times.

Some zip codes are rarely observed because there were no rentals in that
area previously, and there have been been more rentals available in that
area in recent years At the same time, it may be possible that there
were rentals in that area previously, but there were less to no rentals
in recent years. Some rentals may be more available in certain times of
the year, so there will be more or less data during those time periods.
Some zip codes are observed every month because there are enough rentals
readily available that a ZORI score is accurately calculated for each
month. This is the case especially for boroughs and neighborhoods with a
larger population, like Manhattan.

##### Create a reader-friendly table showing the average rental price in each borough and year (not month). Comment on trends in this table.

``` r
combined_zip_zori_df |> 
  group_by(borough, year) |> 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  mutate(year = year(year)) |>

On average, the average yearly rental price has increased overtime for
each borough. The average yearly rental price for Manhattan has
increased the most, with the average yearly rental increased by over
\$1,000 from 2015 to 2024. Except for Staten Island, there is data for
average yearly rental for all years between 2015 to 2024. Staten Island
has no data on rental price from 2015 to 2019.

On average, NYC rental prices has increased over the years. The plot
shows that the change in price increases significantly starting 2021.
The order in average rental prices across boroughs has stayed consistent
throughout the years, with Bronx having the lowest average rental
prices, followed by Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and finally
Manhattan having the highest average rental prices in NYC. The plot also
shows that there is only data for rental prices in Staten Island
starting 2020.

##### Compute the average rental price within each ZIP code over each month in 2023. Make a reader-friendly plot showing the distribution of ZIP-code-level rental prices across boroughs; put differently, your plot should facilitate the comparison of the distribution of average rental prices across boroughs. Comment on this plot.

The boxplot shows that the order of boroughs from lowest to highest
average rental prices remained the same, even when only looking at data
from 2023. Staten island has the lowest range of rental prices, while
Manhattan has the largest range of rental prices, having rental prices
as low as over \$2,000 to as high as over \$8,000. Manhattan has the
largest interquartile range, while Staten Island has the smallest
interquartile range. Queens and Manhattan also have outliers present in
the higher range of mean rental prices.

  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| sex    | less than high school | high school equivalent | more than high school |
|:-------|----------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|
| male   |                    27 |                     35 |                    56 |
| female |                    28 |                     23 |                    59 |

There are more individuals who are in the more than high school
education category compared to other education categories, even when
stratified by male and female. Among males, there is a larger number of
individuals who have a high school equivalent compared to less than high
school. On the other hand, among females, there is a higher number of
individuals who are categorized in less than high school compared to
high school equivalent education category.

##### Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category.

``` r
nhanes_covar_accel_df |>
  distinct(seqn, sex, education, age) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) +
  facet_grid(sex ~ education) +
  labs(
    x = "Age (years)",
    y = "Count", 
    title = "Distribution of Age by Sex and Education", 
    caption = "Data from NHANES"
  ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kr3145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="90%" />

The histogram shows that among males, there is a relatively even
distribution of age for each education category. Among females, there is
also a relatively even distribution of age for those in the less than
high school and high school equivalent education categories. For females
in the more than high school education category, the age distribution
appears slightly right skewed, with more females below 40’s.

##### Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

``` r
nhanes_covar_accel_df |>
  group_by(seqn, sex, education, age) |>

Across all sex and education categories, as age increases, the total
activity in minutes decreases, on average. For those in the high school
equivalent and more than high school education categories, females have
higher total activity throughout the day compared to males. In the less
than high school education category, females have higher total activity
recorded compared to males in those 40 years old and younger. However,
for those older than 40 years in the less than high school category,
males recorded higher total activity compared females.

##### Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph; including smooth trends may help identify differences.

Across all sex and education categories, the activity time in minutes is
the lowest during the earliest and latest time of the 24-hour day, with
more activity time during the day between 500 and 1000 minutes. There is
a decrease in activity between 0 to 250 minutes, followed by a sharp
increase in activity time until 500 minutes, and a sharp decrease after
1000 minutes across all sexes and education categories. On average,
females have higher activity time throughout the day compared to males
across all education categories. It also appears that as an individual
has a higher education, there is a larger increase in gap of activity
time between males and females. More specifically, while the difference
in activity times between males and females does not appear as
significant among those in the less than high school education category,
those in more than high school education category have a larger
difference in activity time between females and males. The plots also
show that those with high school equivalent education have the lowest
peak in average activity time during the day compared to those with less
than high school and more than high school education.
